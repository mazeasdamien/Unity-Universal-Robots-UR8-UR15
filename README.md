## Running Locally

Due to browser security restrictions, you cannot run this project by simply opening the `index.html` file directly. It must be served by a web server.

A simple way to do this is to use Python's built-in HTTP server.

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory** in your terminal.
2.  **Start the server** by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
3.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```
